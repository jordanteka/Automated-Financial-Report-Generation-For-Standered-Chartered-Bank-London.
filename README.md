# Automated-Financial-Report-Generation-For-Standered-Chartered-Bank-London.
This project automates the generation of financial reports for stock analysis, specifically focused on Standard Chartered Bank, The reports in  key financial metrics, stock performance insights, and visualizations, all packaged into a PDF file, can be scheduled to run at specific intervals (daily, weekly, or monthly) for continuous analysis.


Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Fetch historical stock data for a specified company (e.g., Standard Chartered Bank).

Calculate key financial metrics like Annualized Return, Volatility, Sharpe Ratio, and Max Drawdown.

Generate a report with visualizations of the stock’s performance over time, including risk and return metrics.

Automatically generate a PDF report that includes all of the above.

(Optional) Set up automation to fetch data and generate reports periodically (using task scheduling).

Key Features
Data Fetching: Fetches stock data using the Yahoo Finance API (via yfinance library).

Financial Metrics Calculation: Calculates essential metrics such as Annualized Return, Volatility, Sharpe Ratio, and more.

Data Visualization: Generates visual charts, including:

Stock Performance over time.

Moving Averages and Risk vs. Return analysis.

Automated PDF Report Generation: Compiles the data, metrics, and charts into a clean, professional-looking PDF report using the ReportLab library.

Automation: Ability to set up automation for fetching data and generating reports periodically (e.g., daily or weekly).

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Required libraries (use requirements.txt to install all dependencies):

yfinance - for fetching stock data.

pandas - for data manipulation and calculations.

numpy - for numerical calculations.

matplotlib - for visualizing stock performance and metrics.

reportlab - for generating PDF reports.

datetime - for handling date/time operations.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-financial-report.git
cd automated-financial-report
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Set the Ticker and Date Range:

Modify the ticker and start_date/end_date in the main.py file to specify the stock symbol and date range.

python
Copy
Edit
ticker = 'STAN.L'  # Example for Standard Chartered Bank
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2025-01-01'
Run the Report Generation Script:

After setting up, run the script to fetch data, calculate metrics, and generate a report.

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Automating the Process:

For scheduling the report generation to run periodically, use Task Scheduler (Windows) or Cron Jobs (Linux/MacOS) to execute the script at a specified interval (e.g., daily or weekly).

Example cron job for running the script daily at 9 AM:

bash
Copy
Edit
0 9 * * * python /path/to/your/script.py
PDF Report Output:

The generated PDF report will be saved in the output folder. You can view it using any PDF reader.

Customization
Additional Metrics: Feel free to add more financial metrics or calculations to the main.py file to enhance the report (e.g., moving averages, Bollinger Bands, etc.).

Email Automation: If you want to send the reports automatically to an email, integrate smtplib in the script to send the PDF via email after report generation.

Example Output
The generated PDF report includes:

A summary of the stock’s performance.

Key metrics like Annualized Return, Volatility, Sharpe Ratio, and Max Drawdown.

A chart showing the stock's Performance over time.

Visualizations like Moving Averages and Risk/Return analysis.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the project.

Ready to Deploy
Now your Automated Financial Report Generation tool is fully set up and ready to be deployed.

You can schedule this to run periodically to analyze stocks and generate reports automatically, or run it manually to generate a report at any time.
